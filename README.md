# agentic-rag-app
A multi-agent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application powered by CrewAI, LangChain, and OpenAI API.   This project orchestrates autonomous AI agents—Researcher, Writer, Critic, and Reviser—working together in a loop to generate, refine, and deliver high-quality content without human intervention.
